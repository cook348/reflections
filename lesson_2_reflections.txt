What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git directory so it can start tracking your files.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an area to organize the current changes and/or new files that are going to be added to the next commit.  This provides focus and organization.
